# EDR Telemetry Website

Welcome to the **EDR Telemetry Website**, the official site for the [EDR Telemetry Project](https://github.com/tsale/EDR-Telemetry). This website provides a comprehensive comparison of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions based on their telemetry capabilities.

## Overview

The EDR Telemetry Project aims to help organizations and security professionals make informed decisions when selecting EDR solutions by providing detailed comparisons of telemetry data collected by various EDR tools.

## Features

- **Platform Selection**: Compare EDR telemetry for different operating systems (Windows, Linux).
- **Telemetry Tables**: Interactive tables displaying detailed telemetry capabilities of each EDR solution.
- **Scoring System**: An objective scoring system to rank EDR solutions based on their telemetry features and importance.
- **Comparison Mode**: Ability to compare selected EDRs side-by-side.
- **About Section**: Learn more about the project and the author.
