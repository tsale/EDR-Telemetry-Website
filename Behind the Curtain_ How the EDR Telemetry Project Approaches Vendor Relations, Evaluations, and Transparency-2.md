# Behind the Curtain: How the EDR Telemetry Project Approaches Vendor Relations, Evaluations, and Transparency

In the crowded and often confusing market of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions, security practitioners are constantly challenged to see beyond marketing claims and understand what’s truly happening under the hood. The EDR Telemetry Project was founded on a simple but powerful idea: to bring clarity to this space by focusing on the telemetry data that EDR products generate. This isn’t about which product has the flashiest dashboard or the most aggressive marketing campaign; it’s about the data.

Today, we are taking a significant step forward in our commitment to transparency. We are introducing a new set of transparency indicators that provide deeper insight into our evaluation process and our relationships with vendors. This article explains why we are launching this initiative, how it works, and what it means for you. We believe that by openly sharing details about vendor access, engagement models, and our stance on NDAs, we can empower the community to make even more informed decisions.

## Who This Is For

This article is for the security professionals on the front lines:

*   **Security practitioners** evaluating EDR solutions for their organizations.
*   **Consultants and MSSPs** conducting EDR assessments for clients.
*   **Security leaders** looking to compare vendors based on evidence, not just promises.
*   **Vendors** who want to understand our process and how we work.
*   **Community members** who contribute to our data and validation efforts.

Our audience is technical and aware of the industry landscape. We aim to be professional, neutral, and direct, but also approachable. We’re all in this together, trying to make the industry better.

## What the EDR Telemetry Project Is (and Isn’t)

The EDR Telemetry Project is an independent, vendor-neutral initiative focused on evaluating the availability and quality of EDR telemetry. Our goal is to understand what data EDRs *actually* generate, helping practitioners make informed decisions based on evidence. 

It's important to clarify what we are **not**:

*   A detection efficacy test.
*   A prevention or blocking comparison.
*   A marketing endorsement platform.

Our core focus is, and will always be, on **telemetry visibility and validation**.

## What We Ask of Vendors

To facilitate a thorough and fair evaluation, our requests of vendors are straightforward and designed to be minimally burdensome:

*   **Time-limited evaluation access** or a trial license to the product.
*   The **ability to generate telemetry** in a controlled test environment to verify data output.

That’s it. We do not ask for payment, marketing agreements, or special treatment. Our goal is simply to get hands-on with the product in a way that allows for credible, independent analysis.

## How We Engage with Vendors

We believe in open engagement and providing clear context on how we validate information. Our evaluation process follows several distinct validation paths, each with a different level of access and verification. These are validation paths, not product ratings.

*   **Independent Verification (Direct Access):** This is our gold standard. It is achieved when the project is granted direct, unfettered access to a product for independent testing. This can be provided by the vendor or by a verified, independent member of the community.

*   **Evidence-Based (No Direct Access):** In this model, vendors provide evidence such as screenshots, data exports, or documentation, but do not grant independent access to the product. While valuable, it is not a substitute for hands-on testing, and we label these results accordingly.

*   **Conditional Verification (Access via NDA/Terms):** Sometimes, a vendor provides access or evidence but requires a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or other terms. We may agree if the terms allow for independent validation and neutral publication of our findings. This provides more confidence than evidence-alone, but the restrictions are noted.

## The New Transparency Indicators

To make these validation paths clear, we are introducing a set of transparency indicators. Here’s how they work:

*   **What they look like:** Each vendor will have a small icon or banner next to their name on our platform.
*   **Where they are shown:** The indicator will be displayed prominently in the vendor’s header or on the main comparison table.
*   **What they mean:** Hovering over the indicator will reveal a tooltip with a concise summary of the validation path, such as:
    *   **Direct Access:** “Validation was performed with direct, independent access to the product.”
    *   **Community-Verified:** “Validation was performed by a verified, independent community member with direct product access.”
    *   **Evidence-Only:** “Validation was based on evidence provided by the vendor, without direct access.”
    *   **Conditional Access:** “Validation was performed under an NDA or other terms. Click to learn more.”

Vendors do not have the ability to comment on or alter these indicators, as they are factual statements about the evaluation process.

## Our Principled Stance on NDAs

We often get asked why we decline some NDAs. The reason is simple: **our independence is not for sale**. We prioritize the project's integrity over gaining access to a product. To clarify our position, here are our NDA acceptance criteria:

*   **What we generally accept:** Terms that protect a vendor’s confidential information, such as unpublished product internals, roadmaps, or non-public pricing.
*   **What we will not accept:** Terms that restrict our ability to publish findings, force pre-approval of content, limit comparisons to other vendors, or include gag clauses.

Declining an NDA is a principled decision to uphold our commitment to neutrality and transparency. It is not a judgment on the vendor or their product.

## Transparency Over Punishment

Our approach to transparency is informational, not punitive. We do not reduce scores, penalize rankings, or adjust our technical evaluations based on a vendor’s level of engagement. Instead, we:

*   Clearly flag any access limitations.
*   Separate the validation context from the technical scoring.
*   Let you, the practitioner, decide how much weight to assign to these factors.

## Community-Driven Validation

A significant portion of our validation data comes from our community of independent practitioners. These contributors are often using these EDR products in real-world environments and can provide invaluable insights. They may publish their evidence publicly or share it privately with the project. 

To reduce single-source bias, especially when a contributor may not be fully independent, a second party (often the project owner) will validate the results. This helps us ensure the integrity and accuracy of our data.

## Public Evidence and Peer Review

Whenever possible, we make our validation artifacts public on GitHub. This includes:

*   Raw logs
*   Screenshots
*   Methodology notes
*   Reproducible outputs

This allows for peer review, independent verification, and community scrutiny. While private submissions are still validated, we believe that public evidence is the gold standard for transparency.

## Balancing Ideals with Reality

We recognize that perfect transparency isn’t always possible. Not all vendors will grant full access, and not all contributors can publish their findings publicly. Our response is to:

*   Diligently document any limitations.
*   Make our validation paths visible and easy to understand.
*   Avoid making hidden assumptions.

## Why This Matters to You

For practitioners, our approach is designed to:

*   Reduce your reliance on vendor marketing claims.
*   Expose the boundaries and limitations of our evaluations.
*   Enable you to make informed trade-offs based on your specific needs.
*   Build long-term trust in the data we provide.

Our goal isn’t perfection. It’s **honesty about what we know and how we verified it**.

## The Path Forward

Transparency is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time achievement. We welcome community involvement, and our door is always open for vendor engagement. We will not compromise our independence, and we will continue to prioritize evidence over marketing, transparency over convenience, and community over authority.

We hope this article leaves you with a clear understanding of how and why you can trust the data from the EDR Telemetry Project.
